% Introduction

This note is intended to describe the design and implementation of the
pixel online software. The pixel online software is used for controlling and calibrating the CMS pixel
detector. In particular, it performs the following functions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Configure the detector
\item Perform online calibrations
%JMT: isn't this outside the scope of POS?
\item Analyze calibration data in online farm (CMSSW)
\item Monitor the detector during data taking
%\item Control the detector environment (DCS)
\end{itemize}

In Section~\ref{sect:overview} the main software components 
are introduced. Next the software organization is discussed.
In Section~\ref{sect:swcomponets} the different software components
are discussed in more detail. In Section~\ref{sect:calib} the
different calibrations are described. Other information about
pixel online software is available at the pixel online
software wiki pages~\cite{poswiki}.
